--This lesson will focus on three topics:

    --Subqueries
    --Table Expressions
    --Persistent Derived Tables

--Both subqueries and table expressions are methods for being able to write a query that creates a table, and then write a query that interacts with this newly created table. Sometimes the question you are trying to answer doesn't have an answer when working directly with existing tables in database.

--However, if we were able to create new tables from the existing tables, we know we could query these new tables to answer our question. This is where the queries of this lesson come to the rescue.

--First, we needed to group by the day and channel. Then ordering by the number of events (the third column) gave us a quick way to answer the first question.
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
   channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

--Here you can see that to get the entire table in question 1 back, we included an * in our SELECT statement. You will need to be sure to alias your table.
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
           channel, COUNT(*) as events
     FROM web_events 
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;

--Finally, here we are able to get a table that shows the average number of events a day for each channel.
SELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
             channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--An important thing to remember when using subqueries is to provide some way for the reader to easily determine which parts of the query will be executed together. Most people do this by indenting the subquery in some way - you saw this with the solution blocks in the previous concept.

--What was the month/year combo for the first order placed?
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) 
FROM orders;

--Determine
    --The average amount of standard paper sold on the first month that any order was placed in the orders table (in terms of quantity).
    --The average amount of gloss paper sold on the first month that any order was placed in the orders table (in terms of quantity).
    --The average amount of poster paper sold on the first month that any order was placed in the orders table (in terms of quantity).
    -- ANSWER FOR ALL 3 ABOVE:
    SELECT AVG(standard_qty) avg_std, AVG(gloss_qty) avg_gls, AVG(poster_qty) avg_pst
    FROM orders
    WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
        (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);

    --The total amount spent on all orders on the first month that any order was placed in the orders table (in terms of usd).
    SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd)
    FROM orders

        (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);

-- WITH Statements
    --The WITH statement is often called a Common Table Expression or CTE. Though these expressions serve the exact same purpose as subqueries, they are more common in practice, as they tend to be cleaner for a future reader to follow the logic.

--QUESTION: You need to find the average number of events for each channel per day.

--SOLUTION:

SELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
             channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


--Let's try this again using a WITH statement.
    --Notice, you can pull the inner query:

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day, 
       channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events 
GROUP BY 1,2

    --This is the part we put in the WITH statement. Notice, we are aliasing the table as events below:

WITH events AS (
          SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day, 
                        channel, COUNT(*) as events
          FROM web_events 
          GROUP BY 1,2)

    --Now, we can use this newly created events table as if it is any other table in our database:

WITH events AS (
          SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day, 
                        channel, COUNT(*) as events
          FROM web_events 
          GROUP BY 1,2)

SELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events
FROM events
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--For the above example, we don't need anymore than the one additional table, but imagine we needed to create a second table to pull from. We can create an additional table to pull from in the following way:

WITH table1 AS (
          SELECT *
          FROM web_events),

     table2 AS (
          SELECT *
          FROM accounts)


SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.account_id = table2.id;

    --You can add more and more tables using the WITH statement in the same way. The quiz at the bottom will assure you are catching all of the necessary components of these new queries.
